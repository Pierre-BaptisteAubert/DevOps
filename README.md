### 1-1 For which reason is it better to run the container with a flag -e to give the environment variables rather than put them directly in the Dockerfile?

It is better to use -e to pass environment variables at runtime rather than putting them in the Dockerfile, because it makes the image more generic, reusable, and secure.

### 1-2 Why do we need a volume to be attached to our postgres container?
We need to attach a volume to our Postgres container to persist the database data outside the container's filesystem.

### 1-3 Document your database container essentials: commands and Dockerfile.

1- Create the flask-app with a Dockerfile an init folder with the SQL query
In the Dockerfile :
-put the base image ``FROM postgres:17.2-alpine``
-put a command lign to copy all the query in ``/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d``

2- Build the image with : ``docker build -t pbaubert/myfirstdatabase .``

3- Create the network for the connection between the frontend and backend : ``docker network create app-network``

4- Run the container with : ``docker run -p 8888:5000 --name my-postgres-container --network app-network -e POSTGRES_DB=db -e POSTGRES_USER=usr -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pwd -v 'C:\Users\utilisateur\Desktop\Pb\EPF\S7\DevOps\DevOps\TP1-19-05-2025\datapostgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data' pbaubert/myfirstdatabase``

5- Pull adminer image

6- Run adminer container :  ``docker run -p 8090:8080 --net=app-network --name=adminer -d adminer``

 ### 1-4 Why do we need a multistage build? And explain each step of this dockerfile.

 A multi-stage build in Docker allows us to separate the build environment (where we compile and package the code) from the runtime environment (where we run the app). And whith that, we only have the runtime environment in the image.

#### Dockerfile explained

```dockerfile
# --- Build stage ---
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine AS myapp-build
ENV MYAPP_HOME=/opt/myapp
WORKDIR $MYAPP_HOME

RUN apk add --no-cache maven

COPY pom.xml .
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn package -DskipTests
```

**Build stage:**
- `FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine AS myapp-build`: Uses a Java 21 JDK Alpine image and names this build stage.
- `ENV` and `WORKDIR`: Define and switch to the working directory.
- `RUN apk add --no-cache maven`: Installs Maven (needed only for build).
- `COPY pom.xml .` and `COPY src ./src`: Add project files to the container.
- `RUN mvn package -DskipTests`: Builds the Spring Boot project and creates a `.jar` file.

```dockerfile
# --- Run stage ---
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine
ENV MYAPP_HOME=/opt/myapp
WORKDIR $MYAPP_HOME

COPY --from=myapp-build $MYAPP_HOME/target/*.jar $MYAPP_HOME/myapp.jar

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "myapp.jar"]
```

**Run stage:**
- `FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine`: Uses a smaller image with only the Java runtime (JRE).
- `ENV` and `WORKDIR`: Set up the same working directory as before.
- `COPY --from=myapp-build $MYAPP_HOME/target/*.jar $MYAPP_HOME/myapp.jar`: Copies only the final `.jar` from the build stage â€” not the source or tools.
- `ENTRYPOINT`: Defines the command to run the application when the container starts.

**The result:** a lightweight, production-ready Docker image that contains only what's necessary to run your Spring Boot app.
